# Drowsiness_Detection_System
An IoT based solution to detect the drowsiness level of a person . 


PROJECT REPORT 
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Project Overview
The system for detecting driver drowsiness in real-time and preventing accidents combines various physiological and behavioral indicators to accurately assess the driver's drowsiness level. These indicators include eye movement, head pose, and facial expressions, which are continuously monitored to identify patterns associated with drowsiness.
Eye Movement: The system tracks the driver's eye movements using specialized cameras or sensors. It analyzes factors such as blink rate, eye closure duration, and eye gaze patterns. Slow or irregular blinking, prolonged eye closures, and instances of microsleep (brief episodes of unintended sleep) can indicate drowsiness.
Head Pose: The system also observes the driver's head pose and movements. It uses cameras or sensors to track head position and orientation. A drooping or nodding head, as well as sudden jerks or head tilts, may suggest drowsiness.
Facial Expressions: By analyzing the driver's facial expressions, the system can identify specific signs of drowsiness. It looks for indicators such as drooping eyelids, yawning, or changes in facial muscle tone. These expressions can provide additional insights into the driver's level of alertness.
The system continuously analyzes and combines data from these physiological and behavioral indicators to determine the driver's drowsiness level. It uses machine learning algorithms to establish baseline patterns for each individual driver and compare real-time data against these baselines. This individualized approach helps to account for variations in drowsiness indicators across different people.
To ensure the system's accuracy, extensive training and validation are conducted using large datasets that include diverse driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and weather conditions. This allows the system to adapt and perform reliably across different environments.
When the system detects that the driver's drowsiness level is increasing and poses a potential risk, it provides timely alerts. These alerts can be in the form of visual, auditory, or haptic cues, designed to grab the driver's attention without causing distraction or panic. The nature and intensity of the alert can be customized based on the severity of drowsiness.
The ultimate purpose of this system is to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. By accurately detecting and addressing driver drowsiness in real-time, it aims to increase driver safety, reduce the number of accidents, and potentially save lives.

FEATURES OF NODE RED
Video Capture: The code uses OpenCV (cv2) to capture video frames from the default webcam. It continuously processes each frame to detect drowsiness.
Face Detection: It utilizes the dlib library to perform face detection in the captured frames. The get_frontal_face_detector() function is used to create a face detector object, which is then applied to the grayscale frame to detect faces.
Landmark Detection: After detecting a face, the code uses a pre-trained shape predictor from dlib (shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) to identify the specific landmarks on the face, particularly the eyes. The shape.predictor() function is used to detect landmarks for each face detected.
Eye Region Extraction: Using the detected landmarks, the code extracts the regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to the left and right eyes. These regions will be used to calculate the eye aspect ratio.
Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) Calculation: The eye_aspect_ratio() function calculates the eye aspect ratio based on the coordinates of the eye landmarks. EAR is a measure of eye openness and is determined by the ratio of the vertical distance between the upper and lower eye landmarks to the horizontal distance between the inner and outer eye corners. It provides an indication of whether the eyes are closed or open.
Drowsiness Detection: The calculated eye aspect ratio is compared against a threshold value (EYE_AR_THRESH) to determine if the eyes are sufficiently closed, indicating drowsiness. If the average eye aspect ratio falls below the threshold for a certain number of consecutive frames (EYE_AR_CONSEC_FRAMES), an alarm is triggered.
Alarm and Sound: The code uses the pygame library to play an alarm sound when drowsiness is detected. It initializes the pygame mixer and loads an alarm sound file. The alarm sound is played when the drowsiness condition is met and is stopped when the eyes are open again.
IBM Watson IoT Platform Integration: The code connects to the IBM Watson IoT platform using the provided credentials and options. It publishes events related to drowsiness detection, sending messages indicating whether drowsiness is detected or not.
Visualization: The code overlays the calculated eye aspect ratio value on the video frame and displays it in a window. It also shows the live video feed with the overlay.
These features collectively enable the code to detect drowsiness by monitoring the eye aspect ratio and triggering an alarm when drowsiness is detected, while also integrating with the IBM Watson IoT platform for event reporting.

AMES (number of consecutive frames for drowsiness detection).
Consecutive Frame Counting: The code tracks the number of consecutive frames in which the eye aspect ratio is below the threshold to determine drowsiness.
Grayscale Conversion: The code converts the captured frames to grayscale before performing face detection and landmark prediction.
Real-time Display: The processed frames, eye aspect ratio, and alarm status are displayed in real-time in a separate window.
Keyboard Input Handling: The code listens for keyboard input and exits the loop when the user presses 'q' to quit.
